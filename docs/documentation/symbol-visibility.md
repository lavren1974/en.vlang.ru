```v
pub fn public_function() {
}

fn private_function() {
}
```

Functions are private (not exported) by default.
To allow other [modules](./module-imports) to use them, prepend `pub`. The same applies
to [structs](./structs), [constants](./constants) and [types](./type-declarations).

Note: `pub` can only be used from a named module.
For information about creating a module, see [Modules](./modules).
