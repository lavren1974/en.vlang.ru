# Hello World

```v
fn main() {
	println('hello world')
}
```

Save this snippet into a file named `hello.v`. Now do: `v run hello.v`.

> That is assuming you have symlinked your V with `v symlink`, as described
[here](https://github.com/vlang/v/blob/master/README.md#symlinking).
If you haven't yet, you have to type the path to V manually.
Congratulations - you just wrote and executed your first V program!

You can compile a program without execution with `v hello.v`.
See `v help` for all supported commands.

From the example above, you can see that functions are declared with the `fn` keyword.
The return type is specified after the function name.
In this case `main` doesn't return anything, so there is no return type.

As in many other languages (such as C, Go, and Rust), `main` is the entry point of your program.

[`println`](./builtin-functions#println) is one of the few [built-in functions](./builtin-functions).
It prints the value passed to it to standard output.

`fn main()` declaration can be skipped in one file programs.
This is useful when writing small programs, "scripts", or just learning the language.
For brevity, `fn main()` will be skipped in this tutorial.

This means that a "hello world" program in V is as simple as

```v
println('hello world')
```

Note: if you do not use explicitly `fn main() {}`, you need to make sure, that all your
declarations, come before any variable assignment statements, or top level function calls,
since V will consider everything after the first assignment/function call as part of your
implicit main function.
