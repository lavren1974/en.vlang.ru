# Upgrading V to latest version
If V is already installed on a machine, it can be upgraded to its latest version
by using the V's built-in self-updater.
To do so, run the command `v up`.

<!--
NB: there are several special keywords, which you can put after the code fences for v:
compile, cgen, live, ignore, failcompile, okfmt, oksyntax, badsyntax, wip, nofmt
For more details, do: `v check-md`
-->
